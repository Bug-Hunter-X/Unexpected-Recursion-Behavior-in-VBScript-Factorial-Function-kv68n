This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in VBScript recursive functions. The code attempts to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion, but it incorrectly uses the same variable name for both the function and its result.  This leads to unexpected output. The solution demonstrates how to fix this issue by using a distinct variable to store the calculated factorial value.
